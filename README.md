## Summary  

FirstTrust Bank, a regional financial institution based in Chicago, Illinois, faced critical cybersecurity challenges following a partnership with a fintech platform that expanded its digital services, including mobile payments and cryptocurrency trading. This collaboration drove rapid growth, increasing customer accounts by 150% over six months and escalating daily network traffic from 10,000 to 150,000 events. The bank’s legacy security infrastructure—reliant on manual log reviews, outdated email filters, and password-only authentication—proved inadequate against sophisticated threats. Phishing attacks targeting employees surged by 200%, with attackers impersonating executives to authorize fraudulent transactions, including a $480,000 wire transfer fraud. Concurrently, credential-stuffing attacks on customer accounts rose by 70% due to the absence of multi-factor authentication (MFA), exposing sensitive financial data. Regulatory non-compliance compounded these risks, as delayed threat detection (72-hour response times) and missing MFA protocols violated Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) guidelines, threatening penalties and reputational damage.

To address these challenges, FirstTrust implemented a comprehensive cybersecurity overhaul centered on Mimecast Email Security and Duo Security Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), guided by a structured Waterfall methodology. The implementation began with a 14-day planning phase, during which the IT Director and executives defined goals such as reducing phishing incidents by 85% and achieving full MFA enrollment. CrowdStrike Managed Services conducted a network assessment to integrate Mimecast with Microsoft Exchange servers and Duo with Azure Active Directory, ensuring compatibility with the bank’s hybrid infrastructure. Communication plans were drafted to prepare employees and customers for minimal workflow disruptions. During the subsequent 14-day design phase, Mimecast’s AI-driven threat detection features—including URL rewriting and attachment sandboxing—were configured, while Duo’s adaptive MFA policies were tailored to enforce stricter verification for high-risk transactions like wire transfers exceeding $10,000.

Deployment commenced over 28 days, with CrowdStrike installing Mimecast across email gateways and Duo integrating APIs into the bank’s .NET-based customer portal. YubiKey hardware tokens were distributed to employees, and SMS enrollment instructions were sent to customers. A 7-day pilot phase followed, simulating phishing campaigns to validate Mimecast’s detection rates and stress-testing Duo’s authentication workflows under 1,000+ concurrent logins. Feedback refined configurations, reducing false positives by 30%. Full integration spanned 21 days, deploying Mimecast across all email systems and enforcing Duo MFA for all users. CrowdStrike monitored network traffic for 72 hours to establish baseline behavior, adjusting alert thresholds to minimize disruptions. Concurrently, customer guides and workshops on Duo Mobile usage were published to ease adoption.

The project concluded with a 3-month support phase, providing 24/7 monitoring by CrowdStrike and Duo while the IT team underwent certified training. Outcomes were transformative: Mimecast blocked 85% of phishing emails, validated by monthly threat analyses, while Duo MFA reduced account takeovers by 90%, safeguarding $2.1 million annually in potential fraud losses. Compliance was achieved through quarterly audits confirming adherence to FFIEC and NIST standards, including MFA enforcement for high-risk transactions and sub-4-hour incident response times. Operational efficiency improved significantly, as automated log analysis replaced manual reviews, freeing IT staff for strategic tasks like customer onboarding.
